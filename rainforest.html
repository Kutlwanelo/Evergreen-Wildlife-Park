<h1> The Beautiful Rainforest</h1>
<p>High rainfall, thick foliage, and a vast range of life are characteristics of rainforests, which are complex and varied ecosystems.  They contain a sizable amount of the world's biodiversity and are located in tropical areas close to the equator.  Because they support a variety of plant and animal species and have an impact on the temperature and water cycles, rainforests are essential to the global ecology.</p>
<p>The rainforest is home to over half the world's plant and animal species! These lush environments are defined by high humidity, dense vegetation, and consistent rainfall, creating the perfect conditions for unique flora and fauna to thrive</p>

<div class="herbivores-section">
<h2>Here's our most attracting species in the rainforest</h2>
<h3>Leopards</h3>
<img src="images/leopard profile.jpg" alt="Leopards">
<ul>
  <li>Leopards are stealthy, solitary predators that thrive in dense rainforests.</li>
  <li>Known for their powerful build, spotted coat, and incredible climbing abilities, they stalk prey quietly and often drag their kills up into trees to keep them safe from scavengers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leopards are opportunistic carnivores, meaning they eat a wide range of prey, including deer, monkeys, birds, and even fish.</li>
<li>Their powerful jaws and sharp claws allow them to take down animals much larger than themselves.</li>
<li>Unlike lions, leopards prefer hunting alone, relying on ambush tactics and stealth rather than teamwork.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monkeys</h3>
<img src="images/moneky profile.jpg" alt="Monkey">
<ul>
  <li>Rainforest monkeys are playful, intelligent, and highly social, living in large troops where they rely on one another for safety.</li>
  <li>Different species—including capuchins, howler monkeys, and spider monkeys—use their agility, climbing skills, and strong tails to navigate the dense forest canopy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most monkeys are omnivores, eating fruit, leaves, insects, and small animals.</li>
<li>Capuchins have strong, dexterous hands, allowing them to crack open nuts and catch insects.</li>
<li>Howler monkeys rely more on leaves, digesting them with specialized gut bacteria.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parrots</h3>
<img src="images/parrot profile.jpg" alt="Parrot">
<ul>
  <li>Parrots are some of the most intelligent and colorful birds in the rainforest, with species like macaws, cockatoos, and African greys known for their mimicry and problem-solving skills.</li>
  <li>Their bright feathers help them blend into the vibrant rainforest canopy, while their strong beaks allow them to crack open tough seeds and nuts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Parrots primarily eat fruit, nuts, seeds, and flowers, but some species also enjoy insects and small prey.</li>
<li>Their powerful beaks help them crush hard shells to access food.</li>
<li>Some species, like macaws, rely heavily on clay licks, which help neutralize toxins from unripe fruit.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boa Constrictor (Silent Rainforest Hunter)</h3>
<img src="images/boa profile.jpg" alt="Boa">
<ul>
  <li>Boa constrictors are large, muscular snakes found in tropical rainforests, wetlands, and savannas.</li>
  <li>Unlike venomous snakes, boas ambush their prey and coil around them, slowly squeezing until their prey suffocates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike venomous snakes, boas ambush their prey and coil around them, slowly squeezing until their prey suffocates.</li>
<li>They rely on stealth and ambush tactics, striking at close range.</li>
<li>nstead of crushing bones, their constriction slowly stops the prey’s circulation, leading to suffocation.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Threats and Conservation Efforts</h2>
<p>As one of the most biodiverse ecosystems, rainforests are vital for oxygen production, climate regulation, and wildlife survival. However, with deforestation and habitat destruction on the rise, Evergreen Wildlife Park is dedicated to safeguarding these environments through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserving Rainforest Habitats – Protecting tree cover and restoring natural spaces for species like jaguars, monkeys, and exotic birds.</li>
<li>Monitoring and safeguarding herbivores and predators, ensuring populations remain stable and free from human interference.</li>
<li>Educational Eco-Tours – Teaching visitors about rainforest biodiversity, how species depend on each other, and how humans can contribute to conservation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="visitor-involvement">
