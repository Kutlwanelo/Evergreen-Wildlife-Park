<h1> The Vibrant Wetlands</h1>
<p>Wetlands are <b>dynamic ecosystems</b> that exists at the intersection of land and water, serving as one of the most biologically productive environments on Earth. They act as natural water filters, carbon sinks, and biodiversity hotspots, supporting a wide variety of life-from the tiniest microorganisms to large mammals.</p>
<p>Wetlands boast an incredible range of animals, each adapted to the shifting conditions of these ecosystems. Some spend their entire lives here, while others migrate or use them seasonally</p>
</div>
<div class="herbivores-section">
<h2>Some of our most famous wetland residents</h2>
<h3>Hippos</h3>
<img src="images/hippos profile.jpg" alt="Hippos">
<ul>
  <li>Hippopotamuses, commonly known as hippos, are <b>semi-aquatic herbivores</b> that thrive in wetlands, swamps, rivers and lakes.</li>
  <li>Despite their bulky appearance, they are excellent swimmers and spend most of their day submerged in water to stay cool.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Hippos can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes underwater!</p>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hippos are strict herbivores, primarily consuming grass-up to <b>40kg per night!</b></li>
<li>They leave the water at night to graze, often travelling miles away from their resting areas.</li>
<li>Unlike other herbivores, they don't eat aquatic plants despite living in the wetlands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crocodiles</h3>
<img src="images/crocodile profile.jpg" alt="Crocodiles">
<ul>
  <li>Crocodiles are semi-aquatic reptiles, known for their stealth, strength, and powerful bite.</li>
  <li>These predators have remained almost unchanged for millions of years, proving their incredible adaptability</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cocodiles are carnivorous ambush predators, feeding on fish, birds, mammals, and even other reptiles.</li>
<li>They use their camouflaged bodies to stay hidden in water, waiting patiently to strike</li>
<li>Their jaw strength and "death roll" technique help them tear apart prey after a powerful attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Death Roll Technique:</b> Crocodiles grab prey and spin rapidly underwater, tearing it into bite-sized pieces.</p>
<h3>Flamingos</h3>
<img src="images/flamingo profile.jpg" alt="Flamingos">
<ul>
  <li>Flamingos are beautiful wading birds, instantly recognizable for their pink plumage, long legs, and distintive curved beaks</li>
  <li>They thrive in shallow wetlands, lagoons, and saltwater lakes, where they forage in large, social groups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flamingos consume algae, small crustaceabs, and plankton.</li>
<li>Their unique, downward-curved beaks allow them to filter-feed while dipping their heads underwater.</li>
<li>The more carotenoid-rich food they eat, the brighter the pink their feathers become!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Flamingos stand on one leg to conserve body heat while resting!</p>
<h3>Frogs & Amphibians</h3>
<img src="images/frogs profile.jpg" alt="Frogs">
<ul>
  <li>Amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, thrive in wetalnds due to their reliance on water for survival and reproduction.</li>
  <li>They play a crucial role in controlling insect populations and are highly sensetive to environmental changes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Eating Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frogs are carnivores, primarily feeding on insects, worms, and small aquatic creatures.</li>
<li>Long sticky tongues allow them to snatch prey with lightning speed.</li>
<li>Tadpoles start life as herbivores, consuming algae and plant matter before developing legs and turning into predators.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Frogs can breath through their skin, absorbing oxygen directly from water!</p>
<h3>Otters</h3>
<img src="images/otters profile.jpg" alt="Otters">
<ul>
  <li>Ottets are semi-aquatic mammals, known for their intelligence, agility, and social behaviours.</li> 
  <li>Found in rivers, lakes, and wetlands, they are expert swimmers and rely both on land and water to survive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diet & Hunting Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Otters are carnivores, feeding on fish, crustaceans, amphibians, and small mammals.</li>
<li>They hunt using speed and precision, often working together for better success.</li>
<li>Some species like river otters, are powerful enough to take down caimans!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sliding Play:</b> Otters slide on mud banks for fun-this helps improve their agility!</p>

<h2>Threats and Conservation Efforts</h2>
<p>Despite their importance, wetlands are rapidly disappearing due to human activites and climate change. Wetlands are drained for agriculture, urban expansion, and infrastructure projects,destroying critical animal habitat.Rising global temperatures alter rainfall patterns, causing wetlands to dry out or flood unpredictably.</p>
<p>Evergreen Wildlife Park is committed to preserving wetland ecosystems and ensuring that species like hippos, crocodiles, etc continue to thrive in their natural habitats. Through dedicated conservation programs, Evergreen actively contributes to safegaurding these delicate environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wetland Habitat Restoration - </b>Protecting rivers, lakes, and marshes to maintain healthy ecosystems for aquatic species.</li>
<li><b>Wildlife Protection & Clean-up activities - </b>Working to reduce water contamination and restore clean, thriving habitats for amphibians, birds, and aquatic mammals.</li>
<li>Partnering with conservation authorities to protect species like crocodiles and hippos from illegal hunting and overfishing</li>
</ul>
