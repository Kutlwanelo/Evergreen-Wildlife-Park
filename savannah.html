<h1> The Vast and Thriving Savanna</h1>
<p>The savanna is a biome characterized by a combination of woodland and grassland, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall and distinct dry and wet seasons, creating an ecosystem where both predators and herbivores flourish. Unlike dense forest, the savanna offers unobstructed  views of the horizon, allowing animals to rely on speed, strength, herd instincts for survival and even beautiful views for the visitors.</p>
<p>The savanna is home to some of the world's most legendary creatures, each playing a unique role in the food chain. Large herbivores, such as elephants, zebras, giraffes, and buffalo, roam the plains in search of food, forming massive herds that increase their chance of survival against predators. At the same time, powerful hunters, including lions, cheetahs and hyenas rely on stealth and teamwork to secure their next meal.</p>
</div>
<div class="herbivores-section">
<h2>Some of our most attracting savanna residents</h2>
<h3>Elephants</h3>
<img src="images/elephants profile.jpg" alt="Elephants">
<ul>
  <li>Elephants are the largest land mammals, known for their incredible inteligence and social structures.</li>
  <li>They play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem, from clearing paths in dense vegetation to diggin water holes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diet & Eating Habits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Consume up to 300lbs(136kg) of food daily, includng grass, bark, leaves, and fruits.</li>
<li>Use their trunks to pluck leaves, break branches and drink water.</li>
<li>Depend on seasonal food sources-migrate in search of water and fresh grazing lands during dry seasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rhinos</h3>
<img src="images/rhinos profile.jpg" alt="Rhinos">
<ul>
  <li>Rhinoceroses are large, thick-skinned herbivores known for their massive size and iconic horns.</li>
  <li>They inhabit grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, thriving in areas with ample food and water sources</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diet & Eating Habits</h4>
<ul>
<li>White rhinos are grazers, feeding mainly on short grasses.</li>
<li>Black rhinos are browsers, eating leaves, branches and shrubs</li>
<li>They drink water frequently, but can survive on dew during droughts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Zebras</h3>
<img src="images/zebras profile.jpg" alt="Zebras">
<ul>
  <li>Zebras are herbivorous mammals native to the African savanna and grasslands.</li>
  <li>They belong to the equid family, making them close relatives of horses and donkeys. Their iconic striped coats are unique to each individual-no two zebras have the same pattern!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diet & Eating Habits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Zebras are grazing herbivores, feediing primarily on grasses, leaves and shrubs.</li>
<li>They spend most of their day foraging and need to consume large amounts to maintain energy levels.</li>
<li>Because grass can be nutrient-poor, zebras migrate long distances in search of fresh grazing land.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kings of the Jungle</h3>
<img src="images/lion profile.jpg" alt="Lions">
<ul>
  <li>Lions(Panthera leo) are social big cats, known for their strength, hunting prowess, and powerful roars.</li>
  <li>Lions live in groups called <b>prides</b>, consisting of females, cubs, and a few dominant males.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diet & Eating Habits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lions are carnivorous apex predators, feeding on large herbivores like zebras, wildebeests, buffalo, and even young elephants.</li>
<li>They rely on stealth, teamwork, and strength to take down prey, often using coordinated ambush tactics.</li>
<li>Males typically defend the territory, while females do most of the hunting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cheetahs</h3>
<img src="images/cheetah profile.jpg" alt="Cheetah">
<ul>
  <li>Cheetahs(Acinonyx jubatus) are slender, lightweight bit cats uniquely adapted for speed rather than strength.</li>
  <li>They are mostly solitary but can form small coalitions, usually of male siblings, to improve hunting success and defend territories.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Speed & Hunting Techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheetahs are unmatched in speed, reaching up to 112km/h in short bursts when chasing prey.</li>
<li>Their slim, aerodynamic bodies minimize air resistance</li>
<li>Their non-retractable claws provide traction like running spikes.</li>
<li>Long tails help maintain balance while turning at speeds</li>
<li>Unlike other big cats, cheetahs do not rely on ambushes-instead, they sprint to outrun prey such as gazelles, impalas, and smaller antelopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Threats and Conservation Efforts</h2>
<p>Despite its vast beauty, the savanna faces serious environmental threats. Deforestation, poaching, climate change, and human expansion are rapidly reducing its natural space, endangering both animals and plant life. Many species, including elephants and rhinos, are targeted for their ivory or horns, leading to devastating population declines. Additionally, unpredicatable rainfall patterns caused by limate change are making droughts more severe, putting stress on ecosystems that depend on seasonal cycles.</p>
<p>Evergreen Wildlife Park actively works to protect and sustain the delicate balance of the savanna ecosystem through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that native grasslands and water sources remain unpolluted and intact for both wildlife and plant life.</li>
<li>Monitoring and safeguarding herbivores and predators, ensuring populations remain stable and free from human interference.</li>
<li>Collaborating with conservation authorities to prevent illegal hunting of endangered species like rhinos and elephants.</li>
</ul>
